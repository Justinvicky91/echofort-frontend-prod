  {
    question: 'How does EchoFort detect scams?',

Our system checks the caller number against our constantly updated scam database, analyzes calling patterns, and uses machine learning to identify suspicious behavior. Each call receives a Trust Factor score from 0 (extreme danger) to 10 (completely trusted).',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is call recording legal in India?',
    answer: 'Call recording laws vary by state in India. In most cases, you are allowed to record calls for personal use and evidence purposes. However, we recommend informing the other party that the call is being recorded. EchoFort provides call recording features for Premium Plus and Family Pack subscribers, but users are responsible for complying with applicable laws.',

  },
  {
    question: 'Can I use EchoFort without the mobile app?',
    answer: 'The web dashboard provides access to your account settings, subscription management, scam database search, and analytics. However, core features like real-time call screening, call recording, GPS tracking, and screen time monitoring require the EchoFort mobile app to be installed on your Android or iOS device.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How is my data protected?',
    answer: 'EchoFort takes data security very seriously. All data is encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest (AES-256).

Call recordings are automatically deleted after 180 days, and GPS location history is retained for only 60 days.',

    question: 'What payment methods do you accept?',
    answer: 'We accept all major payment methods through our integrated payment gateways: credit/debit cards (Visa, Mastercard, RuPay), UPI, net banking, and digital wallets (Paytm, PhonePe, Google Pay). Payments are processed securely by Razorpay, Stripe, or PayPal.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I cancel my subscription anytime?',
    answer: 'Yes, you can cancel your subscription at any time from your account settings. Upon cancellation, you will retain access to EchoFort until the end of your current billing period. No partial refunds are provided for unused time (except within the 48-hour guarantee period).',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I file a cybercrime complaint?',
    answer: 'Premium Plus and Family Pack subscribers have access to our Legal Complaint Assistance feature. This provides a step-by-step guided process to file complaints with the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal, automatically attaches evidence (call recordings, screenshots), and tracks the status of your complaint.',
